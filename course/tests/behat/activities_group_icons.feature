Feature: Toggle activities groups mode from the course page
  In order to split activities in groups
  As a teacher
  I need to change quickly the group mode of an activity

  @javascript
  Scenario: Groups mode toggle with javascript enabled
    Given the following "users" exists:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |

    And the following "courses" exists:
      | fullname | shortname | format |

    And I add a "Forum" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Forum name | Test forum name |

    And I click on "Edit settings" "link" in the "Administration" "block"
    And I fill the moodle form with:
      | Group mode | No groups |
      | Force group mode | No |
