Feature: Course activity controls works as expected
  In order to manage my course's activities
  As a teacher
  I need to edit, hide, show and indent activities inside course sections

  # The difference between these two scenario outlines is that one is with
  # JS enabled and the other one with JS disabled, also with JS disabled we
  # add the delete activity checking; we can not use Background sections
  # when using Scenario Outlines because of Behat framework restrictions.

  # We are testing:
  # * Javascript on and off
  # * Topics and weeks course formats
  # * Course controls without paged mode
  # * Course controls with paged mode in the course home page
  # * Course controls with paged mode in a section's page
