This files describes API changes in /repository/ repository system,
information provided here is intended especially for developers. Full
details of the repository API are available on Moodle docs:

=== 2.3 ===

* instance_config_form() must now be declared static for php5.4 compatibility.

* get_listing() and search() file metadata details are now now more prominently
  displayed in the interface. Dates and timestamos are now able to be sorted on in
  the filepicker interface so plugin authors are asked to ensure:
    - Dates are defined as UNIX timestamps
    - Filesize is an integer in bytes

* It is recomended to define function get_file_source_info() to provide more rich
  infromation about the source of a file.

* The API was extended to allow repositories can now support external references, please
  see http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Repository_API for further details.
