  Scenario: Create groups and groupings without the 'moodle/course:changeidnumber' capability
    Given the following "courses" exists:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | 1 |
    And the following "users" exists:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |

      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I set the following system permissions of "Teacher" role:
      | moodle/course:changeidnumber | Prevent |
    And I log out
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I expand "Users" node
    And I follow "Groups"
    When I press "Create group"
    Then the "idnumber" "field" should be readonly
    And I fill the moodle form with:
      | Group name | The greatest group that never existed |
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I should see "The greatest group that never existed"
    And I follow "Groupings"
    And I press "Create grouping"
    And the "idnumber" "field" should be readonly
    And I fill the moodle form with:
      | Grouping name | Not the greatest grouping, but it's ok! |
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I should see "Not the greatest grouping, but it's ok!"
