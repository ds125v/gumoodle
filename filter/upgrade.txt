This file describes API changes in core filter API and plugins,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 2.3 ===

* new setup() method added to moodle_text_filter, invoked before
  filtering happens, used to add all the requirements to the page
  (js, css...) and/or other init tasks. See filter/glossary for
  an example using the API (and MDL-32279 for its justification).

=== 2.2 ===

* legacy filters and legacy locations have been deprecated, so any
  old filter should be updated to use the new moodle_text_filter,
  and any filter bundled under mod/xxxx directories be moved to
  /filter/xxxx (MDL-29995). They will stop working completely in
  Moodle 2.3 (MDL-29996). See the glossary or data filters for
  examples of legacy module filters and locations already updated.
