OU search
=========

Copyright 2011 The Open University


This is a cross-database indexed text-search facility.

It does not do anything on its own, but if you install it alongside
ForumNG, OU blog, or OU wiki then it will provide full text search for
those modules.

need assistance, try the relevant forum on moodle.org.
