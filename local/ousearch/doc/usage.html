<title>Using ousearch</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Adding ousearch support to a module</h1>
<h2>High-level issues</h2>
<h3>Documents</h3>
<p>
You need to decide what constitutes a 'document'. Search results return a list
of documents. Generally a document will be equivalent to a single Web page,
or less. For example, a document might be a wiki page, a blog post, a forum
post, etc.
</p>
<p>
Documents can contain three sorts of searchable text data:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Title. May be blank, in which case your result will display as '(Untitled)'
in the default search results display. Search results which include search
terms in the title are ranked higher.</li>
<li>Content. HTML.</li>
<li>Extra strings. Data that is searchable but not included as part of the
document for display purposes. (Can be used for keywords, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document data</h3>
<p>
Each document needs to be identified. The following pieces of data can be
used to identify your documents and restrict searches (virtually all of them
are optional):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Module name e.g. 'oublog'</li>
<li>Course ID</li>
<li>Course-module ID</li>
<li>User ID</li>
<li>Group ID</li>
<li>Arbitrary string identifier</li>
<li>Two arbitrary integer identifiers</li>
</ul>
<p>
Decide which data is appropriate for your documents.
</p>
<h3>Optional support</h3>
<p>
If your module is designed to work with or without ousearch installed, add a
function like this one (works within a module directory):
</p>
<pre>
/** @return True if OU search extension is installed */
function modulename_search_installed() {
    return @include_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/../../local/ousearch/searchlib.php');
}
</pre>
<p>
You then call this function when deciding whether or not to do search-related
code. It returns true if search is installed, and as a side-effect, also loads
the search library so that you can use search functions.
</p>
<h2>Document manipulation</h2>
<h3>Document add/edit</h3>
<p>
Find the points where your module adds new searchable content, or updates
existing searchable content. (Hopefully your module is designed to do this
via one or two functions and not in multiple places.)
</p>
<p>
If there are two functions (add/edit), you will want to put the search code
into a single function and call it from both places. The search code is the
same for adding or editing a document.
</p>
<p>
Adding or editing document data has two steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a document object that includes the document's identifying data</li>
<li>Use this object to update the text content (title and content)</li>
</ol>
<p>
Here are two functions from oublog that do the above two steps.
</p>
<pre>
/**
 * Obtains a search document relating to a particular blog post.
 *
 * @param object $post Post object. Required fields: id, groupid, userid
 * @param object $cm Course-module object. Required fields: id, course
 * @return ousearch_doument
 */
function oublog_get_search_document($post,$cm) {
    // Set up 'search document' to refer to this post
    $doc=new local_ousearch_document();
    $doc-&gt;init_module_instance('oublog',$cm);
    if($post-&gt;groupid) {
        $doc-&gt;set_group_id($post-&gt;groupid);
    }
    $doc-&gt;set_user_id($post-&gt;userid);
    $doc-&gt;set_int_refs($post-&gt;id);
    return $doc;
}

/**
 * Updates the fulltext search information for a post which is being added or
 * updated.
 * @param object $post Post data, including slashes for database. Must have
 *   fields id,userid,groupid (if applicable), title, message
 * @param object $cm Course-module
 * @return True if search update was successful
 */
function oublog_search_update($post,$cm) {
    // Do nothing if OU search is not installed
    if (!modulename_search_installed()) {
        return true;
    }

    // Get search document
    $doc=modulename_get_search_document($post,$cm);

    // Update information about this post (works ok for add or edit)
    return $doc-&gt;update(stripslashes($post-&gt;title),stripslashes($post-&gt;message));
}
</pre>
<h3>Document delete</h3>
<p>
Find the points in your code where a single document is deleted. Again, it
will be helpful if you have a function to deal with this case.
</p>
<p><i>Note: You do not need to handle the case when a whole module instance is
deleted. That is described later.</i></p>
<p>
To delete the document from search records, obtain an ousearch_document object
as above, then call delete().
</p>
<p>
If you are unsure when to delete a document from search records, the answer
is that you should delete it whenever it should not appear in search. For
example, if a deleted item is not visible to ordinary users but may be
examined by administrators, you should probably delete the search document.
Should it later be undeleted, you should then add it back.
</p>
<h2>Library changes</h2>
<p>
You need to add several search-related functions to your module's lib.php.
These are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>modulename_ousearch_get_document - obtains the full text of an item based on
its document details</li>
<li>modulename_ousearch_update_all - usually called when the ousearch block is
installed; the module should add all its documents</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, you need to handle module deletion in modulename_delete_instance.
We'll cover that first because it's easy.
</p>
<h3>In existing _delete_instance</h3>
<p>Handling a deleted instance is very easy. The only complication is that
the function takes a module ID as parameter whereas ousearch will need
the course-module data (id and course). Here's how to do it:</p>
<pre>
if(modulename_search_installed()) {
    $moduleid=get_field('modules','id','name','modulename');
    $cm=get_record('course_modules','module',$moduleid,'instance',$id);
    if(!$cm) {
        error('Can\'t find coursemodule');
    }
    local_ousearch_document::delete_module_instance_data($cm);
}
</pre>
<h3>New function _ousearch_get_document</h3>
<p>
This function must return the actual content and other information about a
search document. It's needed because ousearch doesn't actually store the content
itself - only an indexed version of the words contained. It is used when
checking and displaying search results.
</p>
<pre>
/**
 * Obtains a search document given the ousearch parameters.
 * @param object $document Object containing fields from the ousearch documents table
 * @return mixed False if object can't be found, otherwise object containing the following
 *   fields: -&gt;content, -&gt;title, -&gt;url, -&gt;activityname, -&gt;activityurl,
 *   and optionally -&gt;extrastrings array, -&gt;data, -&gt;hide
 */
function modulename_ousearch_get_document($document) {
</pre>
<p>Note: <tt>data</tt> may hold an arbitrary value which will be passed through
to the final results (useful if you are customising results display,
otherwise does nothing). <tt>hide</tt>, if set to true, prevents this document
from showing up in search results; it can be used to filter results. Care
should be taken with this, as it is inefficient if a significant proportion of
results might be hidden.
</p>
<p>
Using the fields of $document - courseid, coursemoduleid, groupid, userid,
stringref, intref1, intref2 - this function needs to retrieve the corresponding
item from its own tables or files. It should then create an object that has
the fields mentioned. The URL should link directly to the specific document;
activity name and URL are intended so that a link to the 'front page' of the
module instance can be provided.
</p>
<p>
This function needs to be implemented differently depending on how your module
stores data. For examples, see ouwiki or oublog.
</p>
<p>
Try to implement this function as efficiently as possible. In certain types of
search (such as phrase searches) this function may be called on a large number
of documents before a user's search results can be returned.
</p>
<p>
The -&gt;data optional field can be used to store arbitrary information which
will be passed through to the search result object.
</p>
<h3>New function _ousearch_update_all</h3>
<p>
This function is called when the ousearch block is added (to index existing
douments) or when a module's search data needs to be reset for some reason.
</p>
<pre>
/**
 * Update all documents for ousearch.
 * @param bool $feedback If true, prints feedback as HTML list items
 * @param int $courseid If specified, restricts to particular courseid
 */
function modulename_ousearch_update_all($feedback=false,$courseid=0) {
</pre>
<p>
The function must update documents (using the same procedure as add/edit
above) for <i>every</i> document held by any instance of the module (within the
specified course, or all courses if $courseid is zero).
</p>
<p>
Optional feedback is used during the update process. If it's turned on, the
function should print one or more &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt; tags, taking care
that each tag is always corretly closed. It's useful to print dots or other
periodic indicators of progress since this initial indexing might take a long
time.
</p>
<p>
This function needs to be implemented differently depending on how your module
stores data. For examples, see ouwiki or oublog.
</p>
<h2>Backup/restore</h2>
<p>
Search indexes are not backed up.
</p>
<p>
The restore process needs to include indexing. You should ensure that each
document is indexed after it is restored.
</p>
<p>
It's difficult to do this because usually at the point where you restore a
document, you don't yet have its course-module ID. The easiest solution is to
add code to the modulename_decode_content_links_caller function in
restorelib.php; this function is called after the course-module has been added,
and is only called once per course restore (however many module instances there
were). In this function you can call the update_all function for the course:
</p>
<pre>
// Now fix up search for the course
if(modulename_search_installed()) {
    modulename_ousearch_update_all(false,$restore-&gt;course_id);
}
</pre>
<p><i>Note: If you don't have a _decode_content_links_caller function in your
restorelib.php, your module won't be restoring properly! Make sure you've
implemented one.</i></p>
<h2>Upgrade</h2>
<p>
If your module has already been publicly released then you should add an
entry to your upgrade.php which builds the search indexes. The code below will
probably do the trick:
</p>
<pre>
if ($result &amp;&amp; $oldversion &lt; 2008mmddvv) {
/// Add search data
    require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/../locallib.php');
    require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/../lib.php');
    if(modulename_search_installed()) {
        global $db;
        $olddebug=$db-&gt;debug;
        $db-&gt;debug=false;
        print '&lt;ul&gt;';
        modulename_ousearch_update_all(true);
        print '&lt;/ul&gt;';
        $db-&gt;debug=$olddebug;
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>Search UI</h2>
<p>Now that everything is indexed, you probably want to provide a way for users
to actually search. It's possible to do more complex things (e.g. search
everything on a course) but within your module what you probably want to provide
is a search box that searches just the current module instance. This is quite
easy.</p>
<h3>Search box</h3>
<p>A nice place to put the search box is in the header, just before the button
which appears (if you have edit permission) allowing you to update the module
settings.</p>
<p>The following code assumes you only need the course-module ID to define what
you're searching, and that the languge strings $strsearchthisactivity and
$strmodulename have already been loaded.</p>
<pre>
$buttontext=!modulename_search_installed() ? '' : &lt;&lt;&lt;EOF
&lt;form action="search.php" method="get"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;input type="hidden" name="id" value="{$cm-&gt;id}"/&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="query" value=""/&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="{$strsearchthisactivity}"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/form&gt;
$buttontext.=update_module_button($cm-&gt;id, $course-&gt;id, $strmodulename);
EOF;
</pre>
<p>
Then where you call print_header or print_header_simple and you previously used
update_module_button directly, change it to $buttontext. Easy!
</p>
<p>
You need to do this for every page where you want the search to appear. If you
haven't already, I'd recommend splitting this kind of header behaviour out into
some kind of function.
</p>
<h3>search.php</h3>
<p>
You need to make this file. Include parameters to identify what you're searching
e.g. the course-module ID. It then takes an extra query= parameter for the
user's search.
</p>
<p>
Begin the file by writing your normal logic for controlling access to the thing
users have asked to search (i.e. don't let them search things if they aren't
allowed to see those things). Also print the header. Also, set up $searchurl
which should be a link back to the current search page (without query), this
is used to generate links to the 'next page' of search results etc. Then:
</p>
<pre>
$query=new local_ousearch_search($querytext);
$query-&gt;set_coursemodule($cm);
// ...Set other parameters in query if you want to limit the search apart
// from to the coursemodule, for example to a specific group:
$query-&gt;set_group_id($currentgroup);

local_ousearch_display_results($query,$searchurl);
</pre>
<p>
If you need to restrict results beyond the standard database-based filtering
shown above, ousearch_search also has a set_filter method which you can use to
create a custom filter. (The custom filter will be applied result-by-result
after all other aspects of searching, so it's only suitable for filtering
existing results and not for providing a primary method of selecting results.)
</p>
<p>
ousearch_display_results is a convenience function that handles display of the
search results automatically for you. If you need to customise the display
you can do so by running the query yourself; this returns an array of result
objects.
