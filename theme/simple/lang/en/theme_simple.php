$string['choosereadme'] = '"A great idea solves multiple problems at the same time" ~ Shigeru Miyamoto. Simple is at least trying to be great by solving the following problems: a single theme for phone, tablet and desktop; a single layout for all pages; an easy to extend theme;, a collaboration point for theme developers; a repository of best practice; a minimalist lightweight theme; the opportunity to drop support for IE6 and IE7 and take advantage of modern CSS. It is not recommend to actually choose this theme for production sites.';
