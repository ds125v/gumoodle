Quickmail allows you to send a message to one or more recipients in the Potential Recipient(s) list. 
You can add recipients one at a time by selecting a name from the Potential Recipient(s) list and clicking the Add button. 
You can add multiple recipients at the same time using any of the following methods:
<ul>
<li>click and drag the cursor to select multiple recipients in sequential order</li> 
<li>hold the shift key and click to select multiple recipients in sequential order</li> 
<li>hold the control key (Windows) or command key (Macintosh) and click to select multiple recipients in non-sequential order</li>
</ul>
<p>This message will be sent immediately after you click the Send Email button, 
    even to those iLearn users who have chosen to receive discussion forum messages in digest format (i.e., once per day). </p>
