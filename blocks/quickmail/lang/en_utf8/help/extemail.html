<p align="center"><b>Quickmail</b></p>

Quickmail v2 allows you to send a email through your favorite external email clients (e.g. Outlook, Eudora, Thunderbird)
so that you could keep a record of it in your email reader. If you want to use this feature, make sure that your external
email client is configured correctly. Once you click the "Use external email client to send this message" button, your
email client will be launched, YOUR own email address will be included in the To field, while the recipient(s) that you
selected will be copied over to Bcc field. This way you will get a copy of the email and your recipient(s) will not be
able to see each other's email address.
