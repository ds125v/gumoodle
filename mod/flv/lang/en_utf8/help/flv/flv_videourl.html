<div class="indent">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If Sound, Image or Video are selected, the player will automatically look for the video file in the Moodle course files directory. Use &quot;Choose or upload a file...&quot;.</p>
  <p><strong>Video URL:</strong> The source or location of the media file to be played. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Click on the &quot;Choose or upload a file...&quot; button to play videos from the Moodle course files directory. </li>
    <li>Video file types can be an FLV, F4V, MOV, MP4 or any file type supported by Flash Player. </li>
    <li>If the video file is on a different domain to your Moodle, there must be a crossdomain.xml policy file on that domain. i.e. If your site URL is &quot;http://mymoodle.com/&quot;, and the video file URL is &quot;http://someotherserver.com/videos/sample_video.flv&quot;, then there must be a crossdomain.xml file at &quot;http://someotherserver.com/crossdomain.xml&quot;. Some video hosting sites such as YouTube.com already have a &quot;catchall&quot; crossdomain.xml policy file installed, allowing you to consume media from them without any configuration being necessary.
