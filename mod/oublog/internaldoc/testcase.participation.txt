This script describes steps to test the participation facility from a user
perspective. It is intended to cover most of the UI and features.

NOTE: In this test case, the word 'blog' always refers to the OU blog.

The test steps in this script follow on from each other and aren't independent.


Initial setup
=============

This test case requires:

- a course which has at least two groups defined (G1 and G2).
- two test student users (U S1, who is in group G1, and U S2, in group G2).
- one test teacher (U T1) who is in group G1.

The test server must have debugging set to DEVELOPER level and to display
errors; during all parts of the test script, there should be no debugging
warnings.

The completion system must be enabled for (a) the site, and (b) the test
course.
