== OU Blog Participation Feature ==

=== Description ===

Display user participation within blogs.

Participation is defined as:

* Posts created
* Comments created

=== Capability Requirements ===

A user will be considered to be participating in the blog if the blog is a course blog (not a global blog), the
 blog is not a group blog or the user belongs to the current group and the user has access to post or comment on the blog.

A user who has the capability '''mod/oublog:viewparticipation''' and has access to the current blog
can view all user participation, subject to the groupmode settings and their membership of those groups.
(A user who has the capability '''moodle/site:accessallgroups''' will be able to see all groups regardless of
personal membership).

=== Participation Page Display ===

The button displayed to the user to access the participation screens will disply accordingly.
A user with access to all users participation will see a button labelled '''Participation by user'''
whereas a user with access to only their participation will see '''My participation'''.  These appear
above the topmost blog post visible (below the group selector if applicable).

The different buttons will take the user to two different screens respectively - one showing all participants
and an overview of their participation and one only showing a single users participation but with more detail for
their actual participation.

If a user has access to all users they can also view detailed information per user via a '''Detail''' link which appears
next to the users full name in the table.

The participants to display is as follows:

=== Grading ===

A user with the capability ''mod/oublog:grade'' in relation to the current blog has the ability to add grade values.
This can either be done as a bulk action on the '''Participation by user''' page or as a single update on the more detailed
single user page.

Grading will only be available if it has been set for the particular blog instance in the '''OU blog administration''' '''edit''' screen.
