    <b>Why only two levels?</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Two levels are generally enough for all books, three levels would
    lead to poorly structured documents. Book module is designed for
    creation of short multipage study materials. It is usually better to
    use PDF format for longer documents. The easiest way to create PDFs are
    virtual printers (see

    etc.).

    <b>Can students edit books?</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Only teachers can create and edit books. There are no plans to
    implement student editing for books, but somebody may create something
    similar for students (Portfolio?). The main reason is to keep Book
    module as simple as possible.

    <b>How do I search the books?</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    At present there is only one way, use browser's search capability
    in print page. Global searching is now possible only in Moodle forums.
    It would be nice to have global searching for all resources including
    books, any volunteers?

    <b>My titles do not fit on one line.</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Either rephrase your titles or ask your site admin to change TOC
    width. It is defined globally for all books in module configuration
    page.
