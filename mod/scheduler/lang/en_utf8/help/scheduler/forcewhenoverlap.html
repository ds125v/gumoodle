<h3>Forcing slots addition through a session</h3>
<p>This control allows forcing the addition of slots when the session conflicts with other slots. 
In that case, only "clean" slots will be added. Conflicting will be ignored.</p>

<p>
If not used, the addition procedure will block when overlapping are detected, and you will asked for
deleting previous slots before the procedure can add new slots.
